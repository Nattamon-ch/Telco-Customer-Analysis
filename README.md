# Telco-Customer-Analysis
The "Telco-Customer-Analysis" project leverages Python for telecom data analysis, identifying trends in subscriber service preferences. It includes scripts for data processing, documentation of findings, and a visualization report, offering key insights into customer behaviors and preferences within telecom services.

# Telco-Customer-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes telecom subscriber data to uncover trends among non-senior male and female subscribers across various services. It includes data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to provide insights into customer preferences and service usage.

## Data Description
- `data/telecom_users.xls`: Raw dataset of telecom subscribers.

## Analysis Scripts
- `src/telecom_analysis2.py`: Python script for conducting the analysis and generating data visualizations.

## Documentation and Reports
- `documentation/Telecom_Data_Analysis_Documentation_Updated.pdf`: Detailed documentation of the analysis process and findings.
- `reports/telecom_analysis2.html`: Data visualization report summarizing the key insights.

## Getting Started
To replicate the analysis:
1. Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed.
2. Run the `src/telecom_analysis2.py` script to process the data and generate reports.
3. Review the `documentation` and `reports` for detailed insights.

## Tools Used
- Python: For data analysis and visualization.
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (ensure these are installed for running the script).
